# Olympic Medal Counts â€“ Regression Modelling Coursework
**This repository contains my work for a statistical learning coursework project focused on modelling Olympic medal counts using various regression techniques. The dataset includes population, GDP, and medal counts from 71 countries across the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic Games.**

The objective was to explore and evaluate a range of regression models for predicting 2012 Olympic medal counts based on GDP and population. Tasks included:

- Linear Regression: Initial model fitting and residual diagnostics

- Log Transformations: Testing different input/output transformations

- Poisson & Quasi-Poisson Regression: Modelling count data and assessing fit

- Negative Binomial Regression: Addressing overdispersion with the theta parameter

- Model Selection: Comparing models using AIC, likelihood, and cross-validation

- Uncertainty & Interpretability: Evaluating model assumptions and prediction reliability
